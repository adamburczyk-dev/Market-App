# Trading System — Microservices Architecture

## Project overview

Production-grade algorithmic trading system. 13 independent Python microservices communicating
via NATS JetStream (events) and HTTP (request/response).

**Key docs:**
- Full 24-week development plan: `docs/Plan_Rozwoju_Systemu_Tradingowego_2.md`
- ML/AI integration plan (serwisy 10–13, feature tiers, model stacks): `docs/ml_integration_plan.md`

## Current state

<!-- UPDATE WEEKLY -->
Phase: 1 — Foundation
Week: 2
Focus: Full implementation of `market-data-svc` — fetchers, TimescaleDB storage, Redis cache, NATS events
Done: Repo structure, `shared/trading-common`, docker-compose (postgres, redis, nats, prometheus, grafana, traefik), CI pipeline, market-data skeleton (`/health`, `/metrics`), Helm chart scaffold
Next: YahooFetcher + AlphaVantageFetcher, async storage layer, Redis cache, `MarketDataUpdatedEvent` publishing

## Architecture rules (non-negotiable)

- Every bounded context is a separate service with its own Dockerfile and `pyproject.toml`
- Inter-service communication: NATS JetStream for events, HTTP for queries
- Every service MUST expose `/health`, `/metrics` (Prometheus), and use structlog
- The only way to run the system is `docker compose up` — never bare-metal
- Helm charts must stay in sync with docker-compose definitions
- No hardcoded secrets — always `${VAR:?required}` in compose, pydantic-settings in code
- Define contracts first (Pydantic schema, event type, API endpoint), implement second

## Shared library

`shared/trading-common` — pip-installable package.
- `trading_common.schemas` — Pydantic models shared across services
  (OHLCVBar, TradingSignal, PortfolioMetrics, CompanyProfile, FinancialStatements,
  MacroSnapshot, SentimentSnapshot, FeatureVector — see ml_integration_plan.md Fragment 1)
- `trading_common.events` — Event definitions
  (MarketDataUpdatedEvent, SignalGeneratedEvent, FundamentalsUpdatedEvent,
  MacroUpdatedEvent, SentimentUpdatedEvent, CompanyClassifiedEvent — see ml_integration_plan.md Fragment 2)
- Install in each service: `pip install -e ../../shared/trading-common`

Service A NEVER imports directly from Service B. Shared types go in trading-common.

## Tech stack

- Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x (async), asyncpg
- NATS JetStream (`nats-py`), Redis 7
- `pyproject.toml` + hatchling — NOT `setup.py` or `requirements.txt`
- ruff (lint + format) — NOT flake8/black separately
- mypy for type checking
- pytest + pytest-asyncio + httpx for testing
- structlog (JSON in prod, ConsoleRenderer in dev)
- prometheus-client + prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator
- tenacity for retries
- pydantic-settings for configuration
- PyTorch — NOT TensorFlow (for ml-pipeline-svc)
- MLflow — model registry and experiment tracking

## Commands

```bash
# Dev environment
make up              # docker compose up -d
make down            # docker compose down
make build           # docker compose build
make test            # run all tests
make lint            # ruff check .

# Per-service
make build-market-data
cd services/market-data && pytest tests/ -v

# Kubernetes
make helm-template   # render Helm chart
make helm-install    # deploy to K8s
```

## Code conventions

- Language: conversation in Polish, all code/comments/docstrings/variables in English
- File/folder names: English, kebab-case for services
- No deprecated APIs: no `setup.py`, no `version: '3.8'` in compose, no `fillna(method='ffill')`
- Time-series data: ALWAYS time-series split, NEVER random train/test split
- If something should be an event, propose an event — don't default to synchronous HTTP
- PyTorch over TensorFlow for ML services
- ML labeling: always use Triple Barrier Method (López de Prado) — not fixed-horizon labels
- Feature ranking: always cross-sectional percentile rank, not raw values (López de Prado)

## Claude / Cowork Integration

> This section describes how Claude (via the Cowork desktop tool) fits into the development workflow.
> Claude has internet access, a sandboxed Linux shell (Python 3.12, pip), and can read/write files.

### What Claude can do autonomously

| Task | How | When to use |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Fetch historical OHLCV data | `yfinance` / `stooq` → CSV/Parquet | Bootstrapping training dataset before market-data-svc is ready |
| Download SEC EDGAR filings | `edgartools` + SEC EDGAR API | Seeding fundamental-data-svc test fixtures |
| Fetch FRED macro data | `fredapi` Python library | Seeding macro-data-svc test fixtures |
| Generate new service skeleton | Bash + Write tools | Scaffolding a new microservice from the standard template |
| Run backtests on historical data | Python in sandbox | Quick strategy validation before wiring into backtest-svc |
| Analyze model performance | Python + matplotlib | Reviewing ML results: feature importance, confusion matrix, Sharpe |
| Review code against checklist | Read + analysis | Pre-PR review against the review checklist below |
| Generate test fixtures | Python | Creating realistic mock data for pytest fixtures |
| Write pyproject.toml / Dockerfile | Write tool | Scaffolding new service boilerplate |

### What Claude CANNOT do

- Access live market data in real-time (15–20 min delay from public sources)
- Submit orders to any broker
- Access private APIs without keys provided in the conversation
- Run `docker compose` (no Docker daemon in sandbox)
- Access the running system at runtime

### Suggested Claude workflow per phase

**Phase 1–2 (Weeks 1–4) — Infrastructure & Data:**
```
Ask Claude to: "Fetch 3 years of daily OHLCV for [symbols] using yfinance and save to CSV"
Ask Claude to: "Generate the market-data-svc skeleton following CLAUDE.md conventions"
Ask Claude to: "Write pytest fixtures with 500 realistic OHLCVBar rows for market-data tests"
```

**Phase 3 (Weeks 5–12) — Strategies & Backtesting:**
```
Ask Claude to: "Backtest this SMA crossover strategy on AAPL 2020–2024 data"
Ask Claude to: "Calculate Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown, and Calmar for this equity curve"
Ask Claude to: "Generate walk-forward analysis split for 3-year window, 6-month step"
```

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13–18) — ML Pipeline:**
```
Ask Claude to: "Apply Triple Barrier labeling to this OHLCV DataFrame (pt=2xATR, sl=1xATR)"
Ask Claude to: "Train XGBoost on this FeatureVector dataset with time-series cross-validation"
Ask Claude to: "Plot feature importance and SHAP values for this trained model"
Ask Claude to: "Fetch last 8 quarters of 10-Q for AAPL via EDGAR and return as FinancialStatements"
```

**Phase 5 (Weeks 22–24) — Production:**
```
Ask Claude to: "Review this Dockerfile against the multi-stage pattern in CLAUDE.md"
Ask Claude to: "Generate Prometheus alerting rules for: drawdown > 5%, order fill rate < 90%"
Ask Claude to: "Write a weekly scheduled task that fetches macro data and saves a snapshot"
```

### Data bootstrap instructions

Before ml-pipeline-svc is ready, use Claude to seed training data:

```
"Fetch daily OHLCV for [AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, JPM, XOM, SPY]
 from 2015-01-01 to today using yfinance.
 Save each symbol as a separate Parquet file in /data/raw/ohlcv/{symbol}.parquet.
 Include: open, high, low, close, volume, vwap (if available).
 Validate: no gaps > 5 trading days, no negative prices."
```

## Risk rules (non-negotiable)

- Every signal MUST pass through `RiskEnvelope` (trading-common) before publishing
- No order without `stop_loss` — enforce in `TradingSignal` validation
- Circuit breaker events MUST be subscribed by ALL services that generate or execute orders
- Paper trading MUST run minimum 30 days with positive Sharpe before any live capital
- Max 5% portfolio per position, max 80% total exposure — never override without human approval
- Daily loss > 5% → automatic trading halt until next day
- Drawdown > 15% → flatten all positions, require human restart
- Every strategy MUST have walk-forward OOS validation before activation
- No strategy goes live without backtested Sharpe > 0.5 on OOS data
- Position sizing is drawdown-adaptive: scales linearly from 2% risk at DD=0% to 0% at DD=15%
- Regime-aware allocation: CRISIS → max 15% equity exposure, CONTRACTION → max 35%

## Monitoring requirements (every service)

- ML models: daily drift check (PSI + rolling Sharpe), weekly full DriftReport
- Strategies: daily decay check via `StrategyDecayMonitor`, auto-probation/deactivation
- Portfolio: real-time drawdown tracking, circuit breaker armed 24/7
- Prometheus alerts:
  - `drawdown > 8%` → WARNING
  - `drawdown > 15%` → CRITICAL
  - `model drift PSI > 0.2` → WARNING
  - `strategy Sharpe < 0 (90d rolling)` → CRITICAL
  - `daily loss > 3%` → WARNING
  - `order fill rate < 90%` → WARNING
- Walk-forward revalidation: weekly (Saturday) for all active strategies
- Full design details: `docs/framework_supplement.md`

## Extended event types

Additional events beyond the original 10 (add to `EventType` enum when implementing):
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TRIGGERED` = `"risk.circuit_breaker"`
- `MODEL_DRIFT_DETECTED` = `"ml.drift_detected"`
- `MODEL_RETRAINED` = `"ml.model_retrained"`
- `STRATEGY_STATUS_CHANGED` = `"strategy.status_changed"`
- `REGIME_CHANGED` = `"macro.regime_changed"`
- `FUNDAMENTALS_UPDATED` = `"fundamentals.updated"`
- `MACRO_UPDATED` = `"macro.updated"`
- `SENTIMENT_UPDATED` = `"sentiment.updated"`
- `COMPANY_CLASSIFIED` = `"company.classified"`
- `FEATURES_READY` = `"features.ready"`
- `SIGNAL_AGGREGATED` = `"signal.aggregated"`

- [ ] Uses `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Publishes/subscribes relevant NATS events
- [ ] Includes structured logging (structlog)
- [ ] Has tests (unit + at least one integration test)
- [ ] ML: time-series split used, NOT random split
- [ ] ML: features are cross-sectional rank-transformed where applicable
- [ ] New service: Dockerfile follows multi-stage pattern
- [ ] New service: added to docker-compose.yml and Helm chart
- [ ] Signal-generating code: passes signals through `RiskEnvelope.check_signal()`
- [ ] New strategy: has `StrategyDecayMonitor` integration and OOS walk-forward validation
- [ ] ML model: has `DriftDetector` integration with daily PSI check
- [ ] Trade signals: filtered through `CostAwareFilter` before execution
